# To do

## Important

### Features

- Explain what the app does and the aproach
- Change maxY and maxX from the UI (maybe use scroll weel) (zoom in and out)
- Use actual units in the axis
- Add axis labels (Progress vs Time)
- Add the title Easy Easings .com somewhere
- Feedback button
- Show popup warning about unsaved changes before leaving

## Bugs

### Marketing

- Nice readme
- share on
  - reddit (help from friend)
  - https://www.producthunt.com/
  - http://easings.net/

## Mid-term

- SEO
- Undo/redo feature
- Presets (bounce, elastic...)
- Save work in localstorage
- Dark theme
- Optimize app fps
- Get 100 stars to use open collective

## Future considerations

- Lables on axis for selected points
- Vector based curve and then calculate most optimal points
- Site usable keyboard-only
- Add sounds
- Parse css and create the graph
- If the graph can be a cubic bezier, sugest it.
- Tap <kbd>S</kbd> key to enable symetry mode, when one point is added to a side, it appers on the other as well. would be nice to be able to meove the simetry axis.
